# NBCF-Aus-Instafeed

A feature to help promote, acknowledge, and motivate users for the CTA's of the National Breast Cancer Foundation.

Exploring the primary webpage reveals three primary calls to action: 
```

                                        donate, volunteer, fundraise
                                    
```
After reviewing some recent research, it is suggested that group donations and crowd funding are significantly increasing in popularity, likely due to the influence of social media. As such, this component fetches mock Instagram JSON to display uploads with selected tags (for example, ‘nbcfaus’). The idea of the feature is to help promote and acknowledge participants, while also motivating current visitors for the calls to action.
